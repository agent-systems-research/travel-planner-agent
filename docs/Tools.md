# Tools

- `google_search.py` – placeholder search returning dummy results.
- `hotels.py` – reads `data/hotels.json`; `pick_hotel` chooses by budget & rating.
- `activities.py` – reads `data/activities.json`; `top_pois` selects a few varied POIs.
- `maps.py` – computes distance/time via haversine + average speeds.
- `images.py` – returns a placeholder image URL (picsum.photos).

**Real APIs**: normalize fields (name, url, lat/lon, price, rating, hours) so the agents don't change.
