# Roadmap ideas

- Replace dummy tools with real APIs (maps, weather, hotels, tours).
- Add a **Critic** that checks commute caps and reorders items by neighborhood clustering.
- Support **multi-city** trips and explicit inter-city legs.
- Add **Streamlit** UI with maps and iCal export.
- Introduce **LangGraph** for a visual, node-based orchestrator.
