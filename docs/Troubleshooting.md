# Troubleshooting

- **Budget overrun**: Critic asks to replace paid items. Try lowering hotel tier or reducing paid attractions.
- **Closed POIs**: Opening-hour violation â€“ swap POI or move it to another day.
- **Weird commute times**: The demo uses average speeds; switch to real routing APIs.
- **Empty results**: Check that `data/*.json` exist and your dates are valid (YYYY-MM-DD).
